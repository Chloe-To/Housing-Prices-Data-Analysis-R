# Housing-Prices-Data-Analysis-R
In this project, we evaluated a dataset on home prices together with other variables pertaining to things like internal and external housing attributes as well as temporal aspects. Based on this dataset, we seek to find answers to the following questions:
Is the housing price related to various continuous/numerical variables concerning the area of specific parts of the house)? 
Does the housing price depend on the shape of the property?  
Does the housing price depend on the masonry veneer type? 
Does the housing price depend on the number of floors? 
Is there a single housing-characteristic that is more important in affecting the housing price than the others?

The current report will cover the above by using R language. Data descriptions and analysis will be provided, and statistical tests will be conducted for each of our research questions. For each objective, conclusions will be drawn with sound explanation.
